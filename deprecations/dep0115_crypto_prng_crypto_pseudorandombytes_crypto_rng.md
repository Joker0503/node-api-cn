    description: Added documentation-only deprecation
                 with `--pending-deprecation` support.
-->

Type: Documentation-only (supports [`--pending-deprecation`][])

In recent versions of Node.js, there is no difference between
[`crypto.randomBytes()`][] and `crypto.pseudoRandomBytes()`. The latter is
deprecated along with the undocumented aliases `crypto.prng()` and
`crypto.rng()` in favor of [`crypto.randomBytes()`][] and may be removed in a
future release.
